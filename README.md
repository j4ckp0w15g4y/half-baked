# half-baked

You've tried the best, now try the rest!

Aren't you tired of restaurants that are considered 'good', or 'sanitary'?

'Half-baked' meticulously scrapes the barrel for the spots that you thought closed down. 

'Half-baked' fetches restaurants from the Yelp or Zomato API and filters them by their average rating (naturally only 2* or below).
